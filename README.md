# OCTMNIST-Retinal-Disease-Classifier


**Overview of the dataset**

The OCTMNIST dataset is a collection of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images aimed at facilitating the classification of retinal diseases. It comprises a total of 109,309 grayscale images, each resized to 28x28 pixels for consistency and ease of use.

Dataset Composition:

Training Set: 97,477 images

Validation Set: 10,832 images

Test Set: 1,000 images

**Class Distribution**

The dataset is divided into four categories, each representing a specific retinal condition:

- Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)

- Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

- Drusen

- Normal

Each class contains a varying number of images, contributing to the multi-class classification task.
